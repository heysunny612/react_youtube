        "description": "Anamaria Sayre | May 15, 2023\nArriving at the Tiny Desk not long after becoming the first female artist to have a Spanish-language album top the Billboard 200 chart, Colombian singer Karol G shined brighter than ever. With an all-female crew backing her, the proud energia femenina and the prowess of a band dominated exclusively by women is undeniably brilliant here. It was also the first time in many years, she said, that she hadn't rehearsed without her typical on-stage equipment, like in-ear monitors. \"I forgot how cool it feels,\" she said. Authenticity isn't a prescription for Karol G, it's a natural state — something that she carries with her, waiting for the next opportunity to reveal another version of Carolina.\n\n\"CAROLINA,\" her given name, was also the title of the opening track of her performance, as she got to jamming in a manner atypical for the superstar. Trading her flute and trumpet for an accordion and tuba she \"bring[s] some Mexican vibe to this place,\" she said, with \"GUCCI LOS PAÑOS.\" She paused between songs and offered a cheers to the room, admitting that she had meant to sip her Mezcalito before the previous song.\n\nShe emphasized the rawness of the moment by slowing things down for a stripped down, reggae-leaning version of \"PERO TÚ.\" Sliding seamlessly into a bossa nova-esque \"MERCURIO\" — the version she wishes she'd included on the album — \"La Bichota\" brought the music back up and danced herself off stage. Away from the stadium lights, Karol G's performance wasn't just a blip of normalcy for the pop star — it was permission from the self-described \"happy-heartbreak girl\" to get up, whether in the streets of Medellín or an office in Washington, D.C., and dance with every version of yourself.\n\nSET LIST\n\"CAROLINA\"\n\"GUCCI LOS PAÑOS\"\n\"PERO TÚ\"\n\"MERCURIO\" \n\nMUSICIANS\nCarolina Giraldo (Karol G): vocals\nSusana Vasquez: guitar \nJemma Heigis: piano\nGiulliana Merello: drums\nPatricia Ligia: bass\nCrystal Torres: trumpet\nHailey-Mae Niswanger: flute\nKatiuska Fernandes: percussion\nIrany Martinez: accordion\nIndia Anderson: tuba\nRob Trujillo: musical director\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Anamaria Sayre \nDirector/Editor: Kara Frame\nAudio Engineer: Josh Rogosin \nCreative Director: Bob Boilen \nSeries Producer: Bobby Carter \nVideographers:  Kara Frame, Joshua Bryant, Sofia Seidel, Michael Zamora\nAudio Assistant: Josephine Nyounai\nProduction Assistant: Ashley Pointer\nTiny Desk Team: Suraya Mohamed, Maia Stern, Hazel Cills, Marissa Lorusso, Pilar Galván, Jill Britton\nVP, Visuals and Music: Keith Jenkins\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n#tinydesk #eltiny #karolg",

        "description": "The end of the road begins Friday. Watch the FINAL TRAILER Now. #FASTX \n\nGet tickets now: https://tickets.fastxmovie.com/\n\nThe end of the road begins. \n\nFast X, the tenth film in the Fast & Furious Saga, launches the final chapters of one of cinema’s most storied and popular global franchises, now in its third decade and still going strong with the same core cast and characters as when it began.\n\nOver many missions and against impossible odds, Dom Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his family have outsmarted, out-nerved and outdriven every foe in their path. Now, they confront the most lethal opponent they’ve ever faced: A terrifying threat emerging from the shadows of the past who’s fueled by blood revenge, and who is determined to shatter this family and destroy everything—and everyone—that Dom loves, forever.  \n \nIn 2011’s Fast Five, Dom and his crew took out nefarious Brazilian drug kingpin Hernan Reyes and decapitated his empire on a bridge in Rio De Janeiro. What they didn’t know was that Reyes’ son, Dante (Aquaman’s Jason Momoa), witnessed it all and has spent the last 12 years masterminding a plan to make Dom pay the ultimate price. \n \nDante’s plot will scatter Dom’s family from Los Angeles to the catacombs of Rome, from Brazil to London and from Portugal to Antarctica. New allies will be forged and old enemies will resurface. But everything changes when Dom discovers that his own 8-year-old son (Leo Abelo Perry, Black-ish) is the ultimate target of Dante’s vengeance. \n \nDirected by Louis Leterrier (Clash of the Titans, The Incredible Hulk), Fast X stars returning cast members Michelle Rodriguez, Tyrese Gibson, Chris “Ludacris” Bridges, Nathalie Emmanuel, Jordana Brewster, Sung Kang, Jason Statham, John Cena and Scott Eastwood, with Oscar® winner Helen Mirren and Oscar® winner Charlize Theron. \n \nThe film also features an extraordinary new cast including Oscar® winner Brie Larson as Tess, a rogue representative from the Agency; Alan Richtson (Reacher) as Aimes, the new head of the Agency who doesn’t hold the same fondness for Dom’s crew as his predecessor, Mr. Nobody; Daniela Melchior (The Suicide Squad) as a Brazilian street racer with a powerful tie to Dom’s past; and legendary Oscar® winner Rita Moreno as Dom and Mia’s Abuelita Toretto. \n \nFast X is produced by Neal H. Moritz, Vin Diesel, Justin Lin, Jeff Kirschenbaum and Samantha Vincent. The executive producers are Joseph M. Caracciolo, Jr., David Cain, Chris Morgan, Amanda Lewis and Mark Bomback. www.thefastsaga.com\n\nOfficial Website: https://www.fastxmovie.com/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/TheFastSaga\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/TheFastSaga\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/TheFastSaga\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@thefastsaga",

The youngest of King Triton’s daughters and the most defiant, Ariel longs to find out more about the world beyond the sea and, while visiting the surface, falls for the dashing Prince Eric. While mermaids are forbidden to interact with humans, Ariel must follow her heart. She makes a deal with the evil sea witch, Ursula, which gives her a chance to experience life on land but ultimately places her life – and her father’s crown – in jeopardy.\n\nSubscribe to DisneyMusicVEVO 🔔 for all the latest Disney music videos: https://www.youtube.com/@DisneyMusicVEVO?sub_confirmation=1\n\nFollow Disney Music: \nInstagram: https://instagram.com/disneymusic \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/disneymusic \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@disneymusic\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/disneymusic\n\nMusic video by Halle Bailey performing Performs “Part of Your World” at Disneyland. © 2023 Walt Disney Records\n\nhttp://vevo.ly/FNuQVO",
